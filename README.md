# Dataset1

> This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

## Summary Findings
>The highest population of the patients were female.
>79.8% of the patients showed up for their appointment.
>The patients are 37 years on average. >25% of patients are below 18 and most of them are below 55.
>Majority of the patients do not have critical health conditions such as hypertension, diabetics, handicapped and alcoholism.
>A larger percentage of the patients scheduled their appointment same day of appointment.

## Conclusion
>The results of the data analysis, appears that female are more health cautious as compared to male and children. Age did not seem to be a major factor, though age group of 56 and above had a higher percentage of showing up for their appointment amongst other age groups and in this age group(56 and above), females where the higher percentage. While Men neglected their health the most by skipping their appointment dates with the Hospital. Therefore, gender is the most important factor in predicting whether patients will miss their appointment or not.
Day of the week for appointment day also can predict if patients will miss their appointment as weekends has the lowest appointment days. It is also evident that majority of the patients schedule their appointment on same day of appointment, so most patients will most likely show up for their appointment if scheduled on same day.
